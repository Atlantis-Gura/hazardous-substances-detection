# Hazardous Substances Detection System

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** ðŸš§

The complete codebase will be uploaded after the associated paper is published and made public.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains the code and data collection software for a hazardous substances detection system, as described in the research paper. The system utilizes TinyML and specialized sensors to provide real-time detection and alerts for dangerous gases and substances.

This hazardous substances detection system is designed to enhance workplace safety by providing early warning of potentially dangerous environmental conditions. It combines mems mos sensor technology with machine learning algorithms to accurately identify and quantify hazardous substances in real-time.
